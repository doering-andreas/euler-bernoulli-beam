# euler-bernoulli-beam
Calculate displacement/slope/curvature of euler-bernoulli bending beam.
This can be done for a disered number of supports `n`.

The live script `getEulerBernoulliExamples.mlx` shows the exemplary use of the live function `getEulerBernoulliFunction.mlx`.

The live function `getEulerBernoulliFunction.mlx` returns beam displacement and its derivatives.

`getEulerBernoulliFunction.mlx` needs the live function `getEulerBernoulliSolutionWithNSupports.mlx`.
